# Svelte News Website
### [See live 🔥🔥](https://svelte-news-app.netlify.app/)

This is simple responsive website built with svelte. I started building this app because the previous day (when I built this:) watched a video and I figured out that svelte is amazing 🤟🏼. That's why I built this app. With css grid and custom navbar[NO CSS FRAMEWORK👀]. I have used `https://inshortsapi.vercel.app/news?{possibleCategory}` for fetching news.
